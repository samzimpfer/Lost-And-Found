<h2>Claim this item</h2>

<div class="itemDisplay">
    <h3>{{ item['description'] }}</h3>
    <p>{{ item['lost_found'] }} on {{ item['date_logged'] }} by {{ reporter_username }}</p>
</div>

<p>Congratulations! You've claimed this item. A notification has been sent to {{ reporter_username }}.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> In a full lost and found app, there would be some verification process here, such as a messaging interface, and also some sort of delivery mechanism. This was out of the scope of this project though.</p>
